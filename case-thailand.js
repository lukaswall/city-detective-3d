  intro: "Bangkok. The Riverlight Gallery's one-night exhibition 'Gems of Siam' ended in scandal: the Emerald Deva, a priceless golden amulet on loan from a private collection in Chiang Mai, vanished from a sealed glass case between 21:40 and 21:55. Four people had motive and opportunity. You have one night, an open city, and a notebook. Find the amulet. Find the thief.",
  howTo: "Work the city. Each location hides evidence in the scene itself - sweep the picture and open every marker. Question the people you meet. Everything you find is filed to your case board. When the board tells one story, name the thief and prove it with your own evidence.",
